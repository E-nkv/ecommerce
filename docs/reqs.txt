Project: Go-React E-commerce Platform

This document outlines the core features, technical requirements, and architectural considerations for building a modern, full-stack e-commerce application.
1. Core Application Features
1.1. Customer-Facing Features

    Product Catalog:

        Homepage displaying featured products and categories.

        Product listing page with advanced filtering (by category, price range, ratings) and sorting options.

        Detailed product page with image galleries, descriptions, specifications, customer reviews, and ratings.

        Search functionality with autocomplete suggestions.

    Shopping Cart & Checkout:

        Add/remove/update item quantities in the shopping cart.

        Persistent cart for logged-in users.

        Multi-step, user-friendly checkout process (shipping info, payment, review).

    User Accounts:

        Secure user registration and login.

        User profile management (shipping/billing addresses, personal info).

        Order history and status tracking.

        Wishlist functionality.

    Customer Support:

        (Future Integration) Real-time chat with support agents.

        FAQ page.

        Contact Us form.

1.2. Administrative Features (Admin Panel)

    Dashboard: Overview of sales, new orders, and user registrations.

    Product Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products and categories.

    Inventory Management: Track stock levels for each product.

    Order Management: View, search, and update the status of orders (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered).

    User Management: View and manage customer accounts.

2. Technical Requirements & Stack
2.1. Backend (Go)

    Framework/Routing: go-chi for a lightweight, idiomatic, and high-performance HTTP router.

    Database: PostgreSQL for its robustness, reliability, and rich feature set for relational data.

    ORM: GORM to map Go structs to database tables, simplifying database operations.

    Authentication:

        JWT-based authentication using access and refresh tokens.

        Access tokens will be short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes).

        Refresh tokens will be long-lived (e.g., 7 days) and stored securely in an HTTPOnly cookie.

    Payment Gateway Integration:

        Stripe: For credit/debit card processing.

        PayPal: For alternative payment options.

        (Note: Twilio is primarily for communications, not payments. We can integrate it for SMS notifications for order confirmations, etc.)

2.2. Frontend (React)

    Framework/Library: React with TypeScript for building a scalable and type-safe user interface.

    Styling: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive design system.

    Routing & Performance:

        React Router for client-side routing.

        Lazy Loading: Routes will be code-split and lazy-loaded to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.

    State Management: A modern state management library (e.g., Zustand or Redux Toolkit) to manage global state like auth status and shopping cart.

    SEO (Search Engine Optimization):

        Use React Helmet or a similar library to manage page titles, meta descriptions, and other head tags dynamically.

        Ensure semantic HTML for better crawling.

        Consider Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with a framework like Next.js in a future iteration for optimal SEO, but start with client-side rendering for simplicity.

2.3. Cross-Cutting Concerns

    API Design: A well-documented RESTful API to serve as the contract between the frontend and backend.

    Security:

        Secure password hashing using bcrypt.

        Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF).

        Input validation on both client and server.

    Deployment: Containerize both frontend and backend applications using Docker for consistent environments and easier deployment.
